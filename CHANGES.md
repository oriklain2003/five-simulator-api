# API Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Added

### Stop Routes for Every Operation
All operations now have **START** and **STOP** endpoints for full control:

#### Random Radar
- ✅ `POST /radar/start` - Start random radar
- ✅ `POST /radar/stop` - Stop random radar

#### Random Radar Decoy
- ✅ `POST /radar/decoy/start` - Start decoy
- ✅ `POST /radar/decoy/stop` - Stop decoy

#### Drone Attack
- ✅ `POST /attack/drone/start` - Start drone attack
- ✅ `POST /attack/drone/stop` - Stop drone attack

#### Rocket Attack
- ✅ `POST /attack/rocket/start` - Start rocket attack
- ✅ `POST /attack/rocket/stop` - Stop rocket attack

#### Main Simulation
- ✅ `POST /simulation/start` - Start main simulation
- ✅ `POST /simulation/stop` - Stop main simulation

### Bonus: Stop All Endpoint
- ✅ `POST /simulation/stop-all` - **Stop everything at once!** 🎯

This is perfect for quick resets - one command stops all running tasks.

### Status Tracking
- ✅ `GET /simulation/status` - Check what's currently running

Returns status for all 5 tasks:
```json
{
  "random_radar": "stopped",
  "random_radar_decoy": "stopped", 
  "main_simulation": "running",
  "drone_attack": "stopped",
  "rocket_attack": "stopped"
}
```

## 🎨 Key Features

1. **Full Control**: Start and stop any operation at any time
2. **Reset & Redo**: Stop the simulation and restart it fresh anytime
3. **Emergency Stop**: Use `/simulation/stop-all` to stop everything instantly
4. **Status Visibility**: Always know what's running with `/simulation/status`
5. **Thread Safety**: Each task runs in its own background thread
6. **Graceful Shutdown**: All tasks check their stop signals regularly

## 📝 Technical Implementation

### Global State Management
```python
running_tasks = {
    "random_radar": False,
    "random_radar_decoy": False,
    "main_simulation": False,
    "drone_attack": False,
    "rocket_attack": False
}
```

### Stop Signal Checking
- Main simulation checks `running_tasks["main_simulation"]` in its loop
- When stopped, it exits gracefully with a status message
- All radar/attack tasks check their flags in their loops

### Modified Simulation Loop
The main simulation now:
1. Checks `running_tasks["main_simulation"]` every tick
2. Exits cleanly when flag is set to `False`
3. Reports whether it completed naturally or was stopped by user

## 📚 Documentation

### Created Files:
1. **QUICK_START.md** - Fast setup guide
2. **README.md** - Full documentation (updated)
3. **API_EXAMPLES.md** - Code examples in multiple languages (updated)
4. **CHANGES.md** - This file!

### Updated Files:
1. **main.py** - All new endpoints and stop functionality
2. **requirements.txt** - FastAPI dependencies
3. **start_api.bat** - Windows startup script
4. **start_api.sh** - Linux/Mac startup script

## 🚀 Usage Example

```bash
# Start simulation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/simulation/start

# Add some noise
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/radar/start

# Trigger an attack
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/attack/drone/start

# Check what's running
curl http://localhost:8000/simulation/status

# Stop everything and reset
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/simulation/stop-all

# Start fresh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/simulation/start
```

## 🎯 Perfect for Your Use Case

> "also for each route add a route to stop it, because sometimes i want to stop the simulation and redo"

✅ **Every route now has a stop endpoint**
✅ **Quick reset with `/simulation/stop-all`**
✅ **Clean shutdown - no orphaned processes**
✅ **Full visibility with status endpoint**

You can now:
- Stop and restart simulations anytime
- Test different scenarios quickly
- Reset without restarting the API server
- Run multiple attacks and stop them individually
- Stop everything with one command

## 📖 Next Steps

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Start the API: `python main.py`
3. Open docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
4. Try stopping and starting operations!

Enjoy your fully controllable simulation API! 🎉
